The toaster project was a project led by British student Thomas Thwaites who aimed to make a toaster from scratch. He bought the cheapest toaster, broke it up into pieces and tried to recreate it using materials from scratch. According to him, his project was a “partial success” because he did in fact create a toaster (which took him 9 months) but it worked for 5 seconds before catching on fire. This example is significant in the context of complexity because it brings to light the idea that development should not be based off of an individual firms output, but off of the progress of economic, social, financial, legal and political institutions. In the toaster project example, Thwaites’ partial success was not due solely on his ability to put parts of a toaster together, but also because of the systems in place that allowed him to such as the economy being able to supply these materials, electricity, labor, etc.

The Ajaoukuta Steel Works is a steel mill in Nigeria that has the largest ever investment in steel production in the world with an investment cost of more than 5 billion us dollars. This example illustrates a transition from a focus on policies to institutions because prior to the Steel Works, it was claimed that government policies negatively interfered with markets but when policies were adapted by poorer countries, there was not much of a significant growth. It seemed as if the Ajaoutkuta steel works followed the steps for success in that it created jobs, would help produce more output for the country, provided capital, and was an investment. But no steel was produced which led the development business to believe that the issue was not policies, but institutions themselves who were struggling with poor management and systemic corruption.
