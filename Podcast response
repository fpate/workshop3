Response to Jahan and Rosling

As defined by Jahan, human development is the enlargement of human choices and freedoms in every day life and this can be achieved through enhancing capabilities such as knowledge and improving opportunities to use the capabilities. The different measures incorporated into the HDI include mortality rates, birth rates, employment rates, and a focus on a long healthy life, improved standard of living and increased knowledge. 

An example of where health appeared to be a precursor to wealth is during Mao-Ze Dongs rule of China in the mid to late 1900s. During this time, China saw decreased mortality rates and soon after with the contributions of Deng Xiao-Ping, China increased its economic wealth, supporting the idea that wealth alone will not improve a country. The people of the country must be provided basic necessities such as health and education for there to be any improvement. The same pattern can be seen in the United Arab Emirates which originally had a high GDP but low child mortality. Through growth of infrastructure and better health services, the UAE too saw improvements.

Lastly, the dangers of using averages when describing development is that there is too much of a difference between individuals countries for average data to be of much help. Rosling goes on to explain that human development must be contextualized to individual countries because what works in one country will not work in another.
