Introduction 

	The purpose of this research is to identify geospatial data and machine learning algorithms that will contribute to the overall understanding of the ways in which gender inequality influences the ever-increasing poverty epidemic in Nigeria. To meet the goal of this research, Bayesian models and generalized linear models will be analyzed as well as survey, CDR and environmental data sets. This work will build on previous research by focusing on poverty through the lens of gender inequality rather than health care access, education, unemployment and government corruption. 


Human Development Topic 

	Home to near 200 million people, Nigeria is Africa’s largest economy and biggest oil producer. Unfortunately, Nigeria has and continues to face trouble in different facets of human development, one of which is poverty. Over 90 million civilians, roughly half of the population, lives in extreme poverty and even more experience chronic poverty. According to the United Nations, Nigeria is growing at a rate of 3.2% a year and will have a population of 402 million by 2050 which is double its current population. Because of its current large population and the fact that it is rapidly increasing, it adds a sense of urgency to the issue of poverty. 
	What makes poverty such a pressing issue is the expansive range of those it affects and what it affects. The rate of death is 3 times higher for those below the poverty line between the ages of 25 and 64. Similarly, poverty directly correlates to lack of education, access to health care resources, economic freedom and shorter life expectancy. The costs of it include health care costs, costs in crime, and reduced economic production. Furthermore, some of the challenges in tackling poverty are that finding accurate data and implementing data science methods can be quite hard in a large and densely populated country like Nigeria. 
	
Poverty is a gender issue.
 
	Women make up a little less than 50% of the nation’s population but according to the World Poverty Clock, they make up a bit more than 70% of those living in extreme poverty. As reported by a McKinsey report, Nigeria’s gross domestic product could grow by 23% ($229bn) by 2025 if women participated in the economy at the same level as their male counterparts. Lastly, according to UNESCO, 5.5 million girls are out of school, 40% of women have never attended school, and nearly 2/3 of Northern women have no education. These statistics are so startling that it would not do the process of alleviating poverty justice to not look at gender inequality. So to make the most out of this research, poverty will be looked at through the lens of gender inequality because when women are not given equal opportunity, they are more susceptible to poverty. 
	One of the main roots of such discrimination in Nigeria is attributed to cultures and belief systems and it manifests from harmful practices such as female genital mutilation, unequal opportunities and unequal access to education and healthcare. As a consequence, this denial of basic human rights paves the way for the expansion of poverty which too often takes away the lives of many. [2,3,5,9,10]
	I would also like to mention that I have seen first-hand the effects of this specific issue as I hail from countries where poverty and inequality are quite prominent: (northern) Nigeria and Yemen. I have relatives who have been deprived of certain freedoms at the hands of these unfreedoms and a primary example is my grandmother who got married at the age of 9, has never attended a single day of school and gave birth to 15 kids by the age of 45. 
	In his novel Development as Freedom, Amartya Sen describes human development as “a process of expanding the real freedoms that people enjoy”. By this he means that opportunities such as education, healthcare and economic opportunity must be enlarged to reach those that have been shut out from such. But Sen makes sure to make it clear that human development is not just about expanding. It also “requires the removal of major sources of unfreedom: poverty as a well as tyranny, poor economic opportunities…systematic social deprivation”. Poverty and gender inequality relate to Sen’s definition of human development as they are both unfreedoms and sources of unfreedoms. They are unfreedoms in that they restrict opportunity and sources of unfreedom in that they make way for other types of unfreedoms. Additionally, by “expanding the real freedoms”, poverty and gender inequality will consequently be alleviated as they are not “real freedoms that people enjoy”. It also must be mentioned that there are dangers that women face when practicing their freedoms. The abduction of 276 female students in Chibok, Borno by Boko Haram in 2014 is a prime example of an unfreedom and demonstrates that there is danger in achieving such freedom. 
	Poverty and gender inequality are both part of the 17 Sustainable Development Goals but relate to almost all of the goals including including “zero hunger”, “good health and well-being” and “quality education”. 


Human Development Process

	Poverty is a man-made international issue that has roots in globalization. Therefore the primary roots of this issue are large national and global systems and everything else inevitably fell into a place that further perpetuated poverty. In the context of Nigeria, the corrupt government and socio-cultural systems are at the forefront of such epidemic. 
	Poverty is quite widespread in Nigeria but it is important to identify which areas tend to have higher poverty rates. In Leidig, M et al., the “Digital Divide” is looked at to map global poverty. The data received indicates Internet access and usage in developing countries occurs more in cities than in rural areas. Of course these results need to be further investigated but they still give insight on where poverty tends to be higher [7]. Similarly, in Ojo, A et al. geodemography of poverty across local government areas is analyzed and an important conclusion from the research is that there is a clear North-South divide in wealth [8]
	Accessibility to water infrastructure or lack thereof also contributes to poverty. Without clean water it becomes harder to break out of the cycle that is poverty. But with proper water infrastructure, agriculture can grow, girls can attend school, and illnesses will decrease.  Ajisegiri, B. et al. models access to clean water and sanitation in Nigeria and reveals that urban areas usually have higher rates of access to improved water compared to outside cities [4]. If poverty is correlated to poor water infrastructure and there are low rates of clean water in rural areas, then Leidig, M. et al. work is supported because it too claims that rural areas tend to be poorer. 
	Poverty is inherently a complex adaptive system. One can not just fully understand lack of food security or unemployment and then claim understanding of poverty. This epidemic is multi-faceted with many roots and many effects and to gain greater understanding of it, all facets that do in fact adapt to one another must be taken into consideration. It behaves as both a complex adaptive social system and complex adaptive economic system. The complexity in the social system comes from the fact that poverty directly affects the people – their access to shelter, clean water, healthcare and food security to name a few. And the complexity in the economic system is that poverty affects unemployment, decreases economic opportunity, and correponds to government corruption which can not all be solved with a single solution.


Geospatial Data Science Methods

	It is of great importance to recognize that there is a long way to go in securing accurate data regarding poverty. It is important that accurate data is collected because from there, in the context of my research, locations of high gender inequality prevalence can be pinpointed, specific causes can be localized and identified, and solutions can start being implemented. In recent years, there has been a significant increase in geospatial data science methods and though different, all provide valuable data. Biases, national instability, and a rapidly changing population have played key roles in the timeline of finding accurate data [1]. Despite this, surveys, have proven to be effective in giving as much information as possible with given situations because of its low cost, ability to reach large populations, flexibility in topic coverage and allowance of anonymity. Phone data and environmental data are also useful in measuring poverty incidence [1,7]. Additionally, the most common methods found through my research include Bayesian models, specifically Gaussian process regression and geo-additive Bayesian modeling, and lastly, generalized linear models specifically Poisson regression.
	Firstly though, for a structured base to look at the intersectionality of poverty and gender inequality, landscape and hotspots of poverty must be analyzed. In Sowunmi F. A. et al., the landscape of poverty is looked at through senatorial districts and districts with similar and dissimilar patterns of poverty incidence were identified. Data used in this research came from the National Living Standard Survey (2004) and Core Welfare Indicators Questionnaire Survey (2006). The NLSS aimed to “collect household characteristics and demographic, education, health, migration characteristics for poverty analysis”. The sample size for the survey was 600 housing units per state and 300 for the FCT giving a total of 21,900 housing units across the country over a time period of 12 months. With given data. exploratory spatial data analysis (ESDA) was carried out which focuses on distinguishable characteristics of data and GIS software [6].
	Bayesian modeling is a statistical model which indicates uncertainty of predictions, inputs and outputs. In Pokhriyal, N et al., a computational framework that combines disparate data sources such as mobile data (CDR) and environmental data is outlined for accurate poverty prediction and uses Gaussian process regression (GPR), a form of Bayesian modeling. The framework consists of models based on specific data sources and each model uses GPR. Each model gives the probability, mean and variance of poverty in a selected commune. This method is effective because the “data ecosystems” do not exchange data. Data is kept private but predictions and their variances are shared[1]. In Bosco, C. et al, gender-disaggregated indicators such as literacy rates, stunting and use of modern contraceptives were mapped using Bayesian geostatistical methods accompanied with measures of uncertainty across four low income countries: Nigeria, Kenya, Tanzania and Bangladesh. The results indicate that high resolution maps indicating gender-disaggregated indicators can be created with variance through validation being as high as 75% for female literacy in Nigeria and Kenya. The Bayesian model extracted information from the given covariates: Mid-infrared reflectance, elevation, accessibility, the distance to settlements and roads and the distance to conflicts (Nigeria). The study used Demographic and Health Surveys (DHS) which are more than 300 surveys in 90 countries. DHS adopts a cluster sampling design and locations are displaced up to 5 km in rural areas and up to 2 km in urban areas to protect confidentiality of responders [2]. Similarly, in Kandala, N. B. et al., geo-additive Bayesian modeling which allows for non-linear effects of covariates is used to identify spatial distribution of female genital mutilation (FGM) in Nigeria. By using BayesX software package, the results indicated that the national prevalence of FGM in 2003 was 22% but state level prevalence varied with 2.2% in the nations capital, Abuja yet 57.6% in Kwara state. Data was received from the 2003 Nigeria Demographic and Health Survey which surveyed 7,225 households and had a response rate of 99% [3]. Lastly, in Ajisegiri, B. et al, Bayesian inference was used using the integrated nestled laplace approximations (INLA) to provide marginal posterior distributions of the proportion of individuals with access to the specified water/sanitation services. This study received data from the National Water and Sanitation Survey 2015 which surveyed 201,842 households, questioning access to water, sanitation and hygiene (WASH) services in over 50,000 public facilities, including health and educational centers [4]. 
	Poisson regression is a generalized linear model that indicates count variables and which variables have a significant effect on the response variable. This model is used in Bola Lukman Solanke’s Marriage Age, Fertility Behavior, and Women’s Empowerment in Nigeria article. The article aims to study the relationship between age at first marriage and women’s fertility behavior and empowerment. The results of the Poisson regression model in this study are presented as incidence of children ever born in a given category relative to the reference category and the regression method was replicated in three distinct models. Data were extracted from the 2013 Nigeria Demographic and Health Survey and data focused on a weighted sample size of 19,397 women, women who have never had a live birth, and women who were widowed, divorced, and separated. The results indicate that Age at first marriage is significantly related to women’s fertility behavior and empowerment [5]. 
	

Discussion 

	There has a been large shift in my research from the annotated bibliography to the literature review. My annotate bibliography was significantly more general in terms of the intersectionality’s of poverty. In this assignment, I tried to focus more on poverty through the lens of gender inequality rather than education, health care, unemployment, etc. I think there is a research gap in data that directly correlates poverty to gender inequality. I currently have many sources on poverty and gender inequality but not many of the intersection of both.  My previous potential research question was “How do poverty and gender inequality intersect?”  but now I am thinking of changing it to “To what extent does gender inequality influence poverty?”.
