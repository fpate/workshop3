1. The technique used in the reading is called the Random Forest method, which is an algorithm made up of a series of decision trees. Each tree answers a series of questions and then the pattern of answers for all trees is analyzed at the end. 


2. Machine learning algorithms are specific programs that allow computers to take in a large variety of data and come up with the most conclusive results.  For example, the random forest method.  What differentiates a machine learning method from other classical statistical approaches is that machine learning methods are firstly, capable of taking in more data and secondly, are able to give varied possible outcomes and predictions. 


3. Geospatial covariates used in the study which represented a large data set include nighttime lights, topography, land cover and climate information. Big data is highly significant in the finding of correlates and drivers of human populations because it gives us information on the different facets that influence human population rather than a single data set.
