Nieves et a. use the random forest machine learning method to predict what value globally? Describe in detail how random forest works. What is a dasymmetric population allocation? Which geospatial covariates proved to be the most important when predicting global values of where humans reside?

Nieves et a. used random forest to predict population distribution and population density. The random forest method works by creating multiple decision trees that result in a predicted outcome. By comparing the results of individual decision trees, a more accurate prediction can be made. Daysmmetric population allocation is the observing of specific variables such as topography and applying it to a specific area to further observe population counts. Lastly, the spatial covariate that proved most important when predicting where humans reside is topographical features in urban areas.
